Brief Summary:
--------------

"Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert T. Kiyosaki is a groundbreaking book that shatters the myth that you need a high income to become rich. Through the contrasting financial advice of his two fathers — his biological father (the 'poor dad') and the father of his best friend (the 'rich dad') — Kiyosaki presents a new perspective on money and investing. The book critiques the conventional wisdom of the working class — work hard, save money, and invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Instead, it advocates for financial education, investing in assets, and understanding the market. Spanning topics from real estate to entrepreneurship, Kiyosaki explains how to create wealth through savvy investments and financial literacy, emphasizing the importance of making money work for you, rather than working for money.
