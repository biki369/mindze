Brief Summary:
--------------

"Deep Work" by Cal Newport is a compelling argument for the value of intense, focused work in the increasingly distracted modern world. Newport defines 'deep work' as the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. The book, blending anecdotes, scientific studies, and practical advice, illustrates how cultivating a deep work ethic can dramatically improve productivity and lead to a sense of fulfillment. Newport contrasts deep work with 'shallow work' – non-cognitively demanding tasks often performed while distracted – and argues that in our current economy, deep work is becoming increasingly rare and valuable. Over about 200 pages, he guides readers on how to rewire their habits and work environment to minimize distractions and maximize their ability to perform high-value work.
