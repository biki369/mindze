"Who Moved My Cheese?" is a motivational business fable by Spencer Johnson. The story features four characters: two mice, Sniff and Scurry, and two little people, Hem and Haw, living in a maze. They all love cheese and find a huge source of it in one part of the maze. However, one day the cheese disappears. Sniff and Scurry immediately start looking for new cheese, while Hem and Haw resist change, feeling betrayed and victimized. Hem remains stuck in his ways, while Haw overcomes his fears and ventures out to find new cheese, learning lessons and writing them on the maze's walls along the way.
