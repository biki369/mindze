**Title:** Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action

**Author:** Simon Sinek

**Publication Date:** 2009

**Genre:** Leadership, Business, Self-Help

Brief Summary:
--------------

"Start with Why" presents a compelling argument about the importance of finding the 'Why' behind actions, particularly in leadership and business. Simon Sinek asserts that understanding the underlying purpose or belief that drives you or your organization is crucial for inspiring and leading effectively. Over 200 pages, Sinek illustrates his point using a variety of real-world examples, from Apple and Martin Luther King Jr. to the Wright Brothers. He introduces the concept of the Golden Circle, a framework that starts with ‘Why’ (purpose), then moves to ‘How’ (process), and finally ‘What’ (product). Sinek argues that most companies do this in reverse, starting with ‘What’, but the most successful and influential leaders and organizations start with ‘Why’. This approach not only attracts customers and employees who share the same beliefs but also creates a strong, loyal following.
