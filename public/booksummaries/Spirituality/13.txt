The Bhagavad Gita, a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata, is a conversation between the prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. Set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, the text addresses the moral and philosophical dilemmas faced by Arjuna as he prepares to go into battle. Krishna imparts spiritual wisdom and guidance, covering a wide range of topics including duty, righteousness, devotion, and the nature of reality. The Gita's teachings transcend the immediate context of the battlefield, offering profound insights into the human condition and the path towards spiritual liberation. The text blends various paths to spiritual realization, namely the paths of devotion, action, and knowledge, presenting a holistic view of how to live a life of virtue, selflessness, and inner peace.
