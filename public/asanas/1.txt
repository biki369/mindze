Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose)
===============================================

Adho Mukha Svanasana, commonly known as Downward-Facing Dog Pose, is a fundamental yoga posture with numerous benefits. In this pose, the body forms an inverted V-shape, with hands and feet on the mat and hips lifted towards the ceiling. Downward Dog stretches and strengthens various muscle groups, including the arms, shoulders, back, and legs. It enhances flexibility in the spine and hamstrings while promoting a sense of rejuvenation. This pose also improves circulation, energizes the body, and engages the core. Downward Dog is frequently incorporated into yoga sequences as a transitional or resting pose, fostering both physical and mental well-being.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin on your hands and knees in a tabletop position, aligning wrists under shoulders and knees under hips.
2.  **Hand Placement:** Spread your fingers wide, with middle fingers pointing forward. Press palms firmly into the mat.
3.  **Foot Placement:** Tuck your toes under, lift your knees off the mat, and straighten your legs. Aim to keep your heels on or slightly lifted off the floor.
4.  **Hip Lift:** Lift your hips towards the ceiling, creating an inverted V-shape with your body.
5.  **Leg and Spine Alignment:** Straighten your legs as much as comfortable, maintaining a slight bend in the knees if needed. Keep your spine straight, and extend it from your tailbone through the crown of your head.
6.  **Heel Position:** Aim to press your heels toward the floor while keeping them slightly lifted if necessary. The emphasis is on lengthening the spine.
7.  **Head Position:** Let your head hang freely between your arms, with your gaze directed towards your toes or navel.
8.  **Shoulder Engagement:** Broaden your shoulder blades, externally rotating the upper arms to avoid hunching.
9.  **Breathing:** Breathe deeply and evenly, focusing on expanding the chest and lengthening the spine.
10.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold Adho Mukha Svanasana for 30 seconds to a minute, gradually increasing the duration as you become more comfortable.
