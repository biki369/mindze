Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Bend)
=======================================

Paschimottanasana, or Seated Forward Bend, is a classic yoga pose that involves sitting with legs extended and folding forward at the hips. The spine is lengthened, and practitioners reach for their toes or shins. This asana provides a deep stretch to the entire back of the body, targeting the spine, hamstrings, and calves. It stimulates abdominal organs, improving digestion, and promotes a sense of calm by releasing tension. Paschimottanasana is often included in yoga sequences for flexibility, stress relief, and as part of the traditional Ashtanga Yoga primary series, offering both physical and mental benefits through mindful stretching and breath awareness.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin seated on the mat with your legs extended straight in front of you.
2.  **Sit Bones Grounded:** Ground your sit bones evenly on the mat, ensuring a stable foundation.
3.  **Engage Core Muscles:** Engage your core muscles to support the spine and maintain an upright posture.
4.  **Flex Your Feet:** Flex your feet, pointing the toes toward the ceiling, activating the muscles in the legs.
5.  **Inhale and Lengthen:** Inhale as you lengthen your spine, lifting your chest towards the ceiling.
6.  **Exhale and Hinge Forward:** Exhale as you hinge at the hips, leading with your chest. Keep the spine long.
7.  **Reach Toward Toes:** Extend your arms forward or reach for your toes, keeping the back straight. Hold onto your shins, ankles, or feet based on your flexibility.
8.  **Avoid Rounding the Back:** Focus on maintaining a straight spine rather than rounding the back. Gently draw the belly towards the thighs.
9.  **Gaze Forward:** Keep your gaze directed forward to encourage length in the spine and neck.
10.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold Paschimottanasana for 30 seconds to a minute or longer, breathing deeply.
11.  **Inhale to Rise:** Inhale as you slowly come back up to a seated position.
12.  **Rest and Repeat:** Take a moment to rest and then repeat the forward bend if desired.
