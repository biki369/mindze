Halasana (Plow Pose)
====================

Halasana, or Plow Pose, is a yoga asana that involves lying on the back and lifting the legs overhead, bringing them behind the head until the toes touch the ground. This inversion stimulates the thyroid gland, enhancing metabolism and balancing hormones. Halasana promotes flexibility in the spine, stretches the shoulders, and stimulates the abdominal organs, aiding digestion. However, caution is necessary for those with neck issues, back problems, or high blood pressure. It's essential to enter and exit the pose mindfully, engage core muscles, and use props if needed. Regular practice of Halasana contributes to improved posture and overall well-being.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin by lying on your back with your arms alongside your body, palms facing down. Legs should be extended, and feet together.
2.  **Lifting the Legs:** Inhale, engage your core, and lift your legs off the ground, bringing them over your head. Use your abdominal muscles to lift your hips off the floor.
3.  **Supporting the Back:** Place your hands on your lower back for support. Keep your elbows close together.
4.  **Legs Overhead:** Continue lifting your legs until they are parallel to the floor and reaching towards the ground behind you.
5.  **Toes on the Ground:** If possible, lower your toes to the floor behind you. Keep your legs straight.
6.  **Alignment:** Ensure your weight is on your shoulders, not your neck. Keep your spine straight and your chin tucked to your chest.
7.  **Breathing:** Breathe deeply and hold the pose for a comfortable duration.
8.  **Exiting the Pose:** Slowly and with control, release your hands from your lower back. Lower your back, hips, and legs to the floor one vertebra at a time.
9.  **Resting Position:** Once your feet are on the ground, rest in Corpse Pose (Shavasana) for a moment.
