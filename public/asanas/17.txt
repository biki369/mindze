Navasana (Boat Pose)
====================

Navasana, or Boat Pose, is a core-strengthening yoga asana that involves sitting on the floor, balancing on the sit bones, and lifting the legs and upper body to form a V shape. In this pose, the arms are extended parallel to the floor. Boat Pose engages and tones the abdominal muscles, strengthens the lower back, and improves balance. The pose stimulates the digestive organs, aiding in digestion, and can contribute to strengthening the hip flexors and spine. Regular practice of Navasana helps build core awareness, tones the abdominal region, and enhances overall body stability, making it a valuable addition to core-centric yoga sequences.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin by sitting on the floor with your legs extended in front of you.
2.  **Hand Placement:** Place your hands on the floor slightly behind your hips, fingers pointing toward your feet.
3.  **Lift the Legs:** Lean back slightly and engage your core muscles. Lift your legs off the floor, bringing them to a 45-degree angle with the floor.
4.  **Balance on Sit Bones:** Balance on your sit bones, keeping your spine straight. Your body should form a V shape.
5.  **Arm Extension:** Extend your arms forward parallel to the floor, in line with your legs. Palms can be facing each other.
6.  **Toes Pointed:** Point your toes, keeping your legs straight and active.
7.  **Gaze:** Keep your gaze focused on your toes or the horizon to help with balance.
8.  **Breathing:** Breathe deeply and hold the pose for 10-30 seconds, gradually increasing the duration with practice.
9.  **Release:** Exhale as you gently lower your legs and return to a seated position.
10.  **Rest:** Rest for a moment in a comfortable seated position before repeating the pose.
11.  **Modifications:**
    *   If lifting both legs is challenging, start by bending the knees and lifting one foot at a time.
    *   For added challenge, try straightening the legs completely or lifting the hands off the floor.
