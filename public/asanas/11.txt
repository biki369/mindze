Setu Bandhasana (Bridge Pose)
=============================

Setu Bandhasana, or Bridge Pose, is a rejuvenating backbend in yoga. In this asana, practitioners lie on their backs, bend their knees, and lift their hips toward the ceiling. The shoulders and feet remain grounded, creating a bridge-like shape. Bridge Pose strengthens the legs, glutes, and lower back while opening the chest and shoulders. It stimulates the thyroid gland, improving metabolism, and alleviates mild backache. Setu Bandhasana also promotes flexibility in the spine and is known for its therapeutic benefits, including reducing stress and fatigue. It is often incorporated into yoga sequences for its energizing and heart-opening qualities.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin by lying on your back (supine position) with your arms alongside your body and palms facing down.
2.  **Bend Your Knees:** Bend your knees and bring your feet hip-width apart, ensuring they are placed close to your sitting bones.
3.  **Feet Parallel:** Ensure that your feet are parallel to each other and pointing directly forward.
4.  **Arms by Your Side:** Keep your arms beside you with palms facing down. The fingers can lightly graze the heels.
5.  **Inhale and Lift Hips:** Inhale as you press through your feet, engaging your glutes and lifting your hips toward the ceiling.
6.  **Roll the Shoulders:** Roll your shoulders under your body, clasping your hands together. Keep your arms straight and the outer edges of your shoulders pressing into the mat.
7.  **Chin to Chest:** Keep your chin slightly tucked to the chest to maintain the natural curve of the neck.
8.  **Lift Chest Towards Chin:** Lift your chest towards your chin while keeping your neck long. Avoid pressing your chin to the chest.
9.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold Setu Bandhasana for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply.
10.  **Exhale to Lower:** Exhale as you release your hands, slowly lower your spine to the mat, and bring your hips down.
11.  **Rest and Repeat:** Take a moment to rest in a neutral position, and if desired, repeat the pose.
