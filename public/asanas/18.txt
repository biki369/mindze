Savasana (Corpse Pose)
======================

Savasana, or Corpse Pose, is a fundamental yoga relaxation pose typically performed at the end of a session. In this reclined position, practitioners lie on their backs, legs extended, and arms resting by their sides, palms facing up. The aim is total relaxation, both physically and mentally. Savasana allows the body to absorb the benefits of the yoga practice, promoting deep relaxation, reducing stress, and calming the nervous system. It encourages mindfulness and introspection, fostering a meditative state. Despite its apparent simplicity, mastering Savasana is an art, requiring surrender, conscious breathing, and the release of tension, culminating in a rejuvenated sense of well-being.

Steps
-----

1.  **Preparation:** Lie down on your back on a yoga mat. Allow your feet to fall open, with toes pointing outward. Keep your arms by your sides, palms facing up.
2.  **Alignment:** Make sure your body is in a straight line, with your spine lengthened. Adjust your position to ensure comfort and symmetry.
3.  **Distance:** Keep your feet hip-width apart, allowing your toes to gently fall to the sides.
4.  **Arms:** Relax your arms alongside your body, a few inches away, with palms facing up. Let your fingers naturally curl.
5.  **Head and Neck:** Ensure your head and neck are in a neutral position. You can gently nod your head side to side and then find the center point of relaxation.
6.  **Eyes:** Close your eyes gently. Soften the gaze and release any tension around the eyes.
7.  **Breathing:** Bring awareness to your breath. Take a few deep breaths initially to relax, and then let your breath return to its natural rhythm. Observe the breath without trying to control it.
8.  **Relaxation:** Begin a systematic relaxation, starting from your toes and working your way up to the head. Consciously release any tension in each part of your body.
9.  **Mindfulness:** Allow your mind to quiet. If thoughts arise, acknowledge them without judgment and bring your focus back to your breath or the present moment.
10.  **Duration:** Stay in Savasana for 5-15 minutes or as long as you feel comfortable. To exit, deepen your breath, gently move your fingers and toes, and slowly roll to one side before coming up to a seated position.
