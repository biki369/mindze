Baddha Konasana (Butterfly Pose)
================================

Baddha Konasana, also known as Bound Angle Pose or Butterfly Pose, is a seated yoga posture that involves bringing the soles of the feet together, forming a diamond shape with the legs. The practitioner gently presses the knees toward the floor, elongating the spine and opening the hips and groin. This asana is renowned for promoting flexibility in the inner thighs, groins, and knees. It stimulates abdominal organs, improves blood circulation, and alleviates sciatic discomfort. Baddha Konasana is embraced in yoga for its meditative qualities, fostering a sense of calmness and introspection. Regular practice can enhance posture and aid in relieving stress and anxiety.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin in a seated position on the mat with your legs extended straight in front of you.
2.  **Bring the Feet Together:** Bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together.
3.  **Hold the Feet:** Hold your feet with your hands, interlocking your fingers around them.
4.  **Adjust Foot Position:** Allow your knees to fall outward, bringing them as close to the floor as is comfortable. Your heels should be close to your pelvis.
5.  **Straighten Your Back:** Lengthen your spine and sit up tall. Engage your core to support the straightening of your back.
6.  **Flap the Knees:** If comfortable, you can gently flap your knees up and down, like the wings of a butterfly. This motion can help release tension in the hips.
7.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply and maintaining a relaxed but engaged posture.
8.  **Release:** To release the pose, gently bring your knees together and extend your legs.
9.  **Rest:** Take a moment to rest in a comfortable seated position or lie down in Savasana to allow your body to integrate the benefits of the pose.
