Balasana (Child's Pose)
=======================

Balasana, or Child's Pose, is a restorative yoga pose that involves sitting back on the heels with the knees spread apart, lowering the torso forward, and extending the arms in front or resting them by the sides. This gentle, grounding asana promotes relaxation, releases tension in the back, shoulders, and neck, and provides a soothing stretch to the spine. Balasana is often used as a resting pose in yoga sequences, fostering introspection and calming the mind. It aids in reducing stress, fatigue, and anxiety, making it accessible to practitioners of all levels as a comforting posture to restore balance and tranquility.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin in a tabletop position on your hands and knees, with wrists directly under shoulders and knees under hips.
2.  **Knee Spread:** Spread your knees apart, allowing them to be slightly wider than hip-width.
3.  **Toes Together:** Bring your big toes together, touching or with a small gap, depending on comfort.
4.  **Sit Back:** Sit back on your heels, allowing the torso to descend between your thighs.
5.  **Forward Reach:** Extend your arms forward, reaching them out in front of you. Alternatively, you can rest your arms by your sides, palms facing up.
6.  **Forehead to Mat:** Lower your torso toward the mat, bringing your forehead to rest on the floor. If needed, you can place a folded blanket or bolster under your forehead for support.
7.  **Lengthen the Spine:** Lengthen your spine by reaching your fingertips forward while simultaneously grounding your hips back toward your heels.
8.  **Relaxation:** Relax your shoulders, neck, and jaw. Breathe deeply and slowly, focusing on the sensation of the breath.
9.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold Balasana for 30 seconds to a minute or longer, depending on your comfort and the purpose of the practice.
10.  **Release:** To release the pose, gently walk your hands back toward your body, lifting your torso and sitting back on your heels.
