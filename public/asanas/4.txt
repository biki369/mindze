Virabhadrasana I (Warrior 1)
============================

**

Virabhadrasana I, or Warrior I, is a powerful standing yoga pose that embodies strength and focus. In this asana, practitioners step into a lunge, grounding one foot back while bending the front knee directly over the ankle. The back foot is angled slightly outward. With arms reaching overhead and palms facing each other, Warrior I opens the chest and elongates the spine. It engages the legs, hips, and core, promoting stability and strength. This pose symbolizes the warrior archetype, cultivating a sense of courage, determination, and balance, making it a foundational element in many yoga sequences for both physical and mental empowerment.
