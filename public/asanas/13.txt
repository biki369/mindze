Utthita Parsvakonasana (Extended Side Angle Pose)
=================================================

Utthita Parsvakonasana, or Extended Side Angle Pose, is a dynamic yoga asana that combines strength, balance, and flexibility. In this pose, practitioners begin in Warrior II, then extend the torso over the front leg, placing the hand on the mat or a block while reaching the opposite arm overhead. The pose stretches and strengthens the legs, opens the hips, and engages the core. It also improves flexibility in the spine and shoulders. Utthita Parsvakonasana enhances stamina, promotes concentration, and is often included in yoga sequences to build strength and stability while encouraging a sense of grounding and expansion.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin in Tadasana (Mountain Pose) at the top of your mat.
2.  **Step Back:** Step your feet wide apart, approximately 3 to 4 feet, depending on your comfort and flexibility.
3.  **Turn Front Foot:** Turn your right foot out 90 degrees and your left foot slightly inward, maintaining alignment with your hips.
4.  **Extend Arms:** Inhale and extend your arms parallel to the floor, reaching them actively in opposite directions. Your palms should face down.
5.  **Bend the Right Knee:** Exhale and bend your right knee over the right ankle, ensuring the shin is perpendicular to the floor. Keep the thigh parallel to the floor.
6.  **Lower Into the Pose:** Lower your torso, bringing the right forearm to the right thigh. Alternatively, you can place your right hand on the mat outside your right foot or on a block.
7.  **Extend Left Arm:** Inhale and extend your left arm overhead, creating a straight line from the left fingertips to the outer edge of the left foot.
8.  **Open Chest:** Open your chest toward the ceiling, stacking the shoulders. Gaze at your left thumb if comfortable for the neck.
9.  **Engage Core:** Engage your core muscles to maintain stability and support the spine.
10.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold Utthita Parsvakonasana for 30 seconds to 1 minute, breathing deeply.
11.  **Repeat on the Other Side:** To come out of the pose, press into your back foot, inhale, and return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.
