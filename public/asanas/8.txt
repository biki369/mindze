Sukhasana (Easy Pose)
=====================

**

Sukhasana, or Easy Pose, is a comfortable seated meditation posture in yoga. In this cross-legged position, practitioners sit with a straight spine, hands resting on the knees or in a mudra. The legs are crossed, and the feet are placed under the opposite knee, creating a triangle shape. Sukhasana is accessible to all levels and is commonly used for meditation, pranayama (breath control), and grounding exercises. It promotes a calm and focused mind, opens the hips, and eases tension. This foundational pose encourages a sense of ease, making it a versatile choice for cultivating mindfulness and inner tranquility in yoga practice.
