Kapotasana (Pigeon Pose)
========================

Kapotasana, or Pigeon Pose, is an advanced yoga asana that combines deep backbending and hip-opening. In this pose, practitioners begin in a kneeling position, then extend one leg straight back while bending the other knee, creating a hip-opening stretch. The backbend intensifies as the torso arches backward, and the hands reach for the feet. Kapotasana provides a profound stretch to the hip flexors, quadriceps, and chest, while enhancing spinal flexibility. It demands strength in the back, shoulders, and thighs. Beyond its physical benefits, Kapotasana is known for encouraging emotional release and introspection, making it a holistic pose in the yoga practice.

Steps
-----

1.  **Start in Tabletop Position:** Begin in a tabletop position with your hands and knees on the mat.
2.  **Slide One Leg Forward:** Slide one knee forward toward your wrist. The shin should be angled diagonally across the mat, and the foot positioned near the opposite hip.
3.  **Extend the Other Leg Back:** Extend the other leg straight back behind you. The toes should point away, and the top of the foot rests on the mat.
4.  **Square the Hips:** Ensure that your hips are squared and level. The extended leg's hip should point down, and the bent leg's hip should point forward.
5.  **Lower to the Forearms:** If comfortable, lower down to your forearms. Keep your chest lifted and your spine long.
6.  **Backbend and Reach Back:** To deepen the pose, engage your core and begin to arch your back, reaching your hands back toward your back foot. Some practitioners may be able to touch their foot with their hands.
7.  **Maintain Alignment:** Keep your shoulders relaxed, and avoid collapsing into the lower back. Maintain a steady breath and focus on opening the chest and hips.
8.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold the pose for several breaths, gradually increasing the duration as your flexibility improves.
9.  **Release and Repeat:** To release the pose, come back to the tabletop position and switch to the other leg. Repeat the steps.
