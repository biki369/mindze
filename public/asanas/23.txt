Phalakasana (Plank Pose)
========================

Phalakasana, or Plank Pose, is a foundational yoga pose that strengthens the entire body. In this pose, the body forms a straight line from head to heels, engaging the core, arms, and legs. It builds core strength, tones the arms, and improves overall endurance. Proper alignment is crucial to prevent strain, with wrists positioned beneath shoulders and a firm engagement of the abdominal muscles. Plank Pose also enhances balance and concentration. As a component of many yoga sequences, it serves as a transition or a stand-alone pose, fostering both physical and mental well-being. Regular practice of Phalakasana contributes to a stable and resilient body.

Steps
-----
1.  **Starting Position:** Begin on your hands and knees in a tabletop position. Ensure your wrists are directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips.
2.  **Hand Placement:** Spread your fingers wide, pressing through your palms, and distribute the weight evenly across your hands.
3.  **Straighten the Legs:** Step your feet back, one at a time, so your legs are straight and your toes are tucked under. The heels should be directly above the balls of your feet.
4.  **Body Alignment:** Your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels. Engage your core muscles to avoid sagging in the middle or lifting your hips too high.
5.  **Neutral Neck and Spine:** Keep your neck in a neutral position, looking down at the mat. Ensure your spine is straight, and your head is in line with your back.
6.  **Legs and Feet:** Squeeze your thighs and lift your kneecaps. Press through your heels, reaching energy back through your legs.
7.  **Shoulder Blades:** Draw your shoulder blades down your back, creating a broad and open chest. Avoid hunching your shoulders.
8.  **Breathing:** Breathe deeply and steadily. Hold the pose for as long as comfortable, gradually increasing the duration as your strength improves.
9.  **Exiting the Pose:** To release, gently lower your knees to the mat, coming back to the tabletop position.
