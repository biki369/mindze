Sarvangasana (Shoulderstand)
============================

Sarvangasana is a revered yoga pose with a multitude of benefits. In this inverted posture, the body is supported by the shoulders, and the legs extend toward the sky. It promotes thyroid and parathyroid gland function, aiding in hormonal balance. The pose enhances blood circulation to the brain, fostering mental clarity and reducing stress. It strengthens the shoulders, neck, and upper back, improving posture and relieving tension. Sarvangasana also stimulates the abdominal organs, promoting digestion and detoxification. However, caution is advised for individuals with neck issues, and proper alignment under the guidance of a qualified instructor is essential.

Steps
-----

1.  **Preparation:** Begin by lying on your back in a relaxed position, with your arms alongside your body and palms facing down. Take a few breaths to center yourself.
2.  **Lift Your Legs:** Inhale as you lift your legs toward the ceiling, using your abdominal muscles. Keep your legs straight and together, engaging the core.
3.  **Support Your Lower Back:** Place your hands on your lower back for support. Use your hands to lift your hips off the ground while bringing your legs over your head.
4.  **Support Your Back with Hands:** Walk your hands down your back, supporting your spine with your hands. Your elbows should be shoulder-width apart, and your upper arms should be parallel to the ground.
5.  **Straighten Your Legs:** Extend your legs upward, aiming to create a straight line from your shoulders to your feet. Keep your neck in a neutral position, avoiding excessive pressure on the cervical spine.
6.  **Engage Your Core:** Activate your core muscles to maintain stability in the pose. Ensure that your weight is evenly distributed across your shoulders and upper arms.
7.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold Sarvangasana for a duration that is comfortable for you. Beginners may start with shorter holds and gradually increase as strength and comfort improve.
8.  **Breathe Mindfully:** Focus on deep and even breathing. Breathing into the chest and maintaining a steady breath can enhance the benefits of the pose.
9.  **Exit the Pose Safely:** To release from the pose, slowly lower your legs back over your head, returning to the lying position. Take a moment to relax and observe the effects of the pose on your body.
10.  **Rest in Savasana:** Follow Sarvangasana with Savasana (Corpse Pose) to allow your body to integrate the benefits and to release any residual tension.
