# Tadasana (Mountain Pose)


Tadasana, or Mountain Pose, is a foundational yoga pose that focuses on grounding and alignment. In this standing posture, practitioners stand with feet together, weight evenly distributed, and arms relaxed by their sides. The spine is elongated, and the shoulders are rolled back, promoting a strong, upright posture. Tadasana is known for improving posture, balance, and concentration. It engages and strengthens various muscle groups, including the legs, core, and back. The pose encourages a sense of stability and connection with the earth while fostering mindfulness and awareness of body alignment. Tadasana is often used as a starting point for many standing and balancing poses in yoga sequences.

## Steps


1.  **Starting Position:** Stand with your feet together, heels slightly apart, and arms by your sides.
2.  **Weight Distribution:** Distribute your weight evenly across both feet, grounding through the four corners of each foot.
3.  **Alignment of Legs:** Engage your thigh muscles and lift your kneecaps, avoiding locking your knees.
4.  **Pelvic Alignment:** Tuck your tailbone slightly to align the pelvis, ensuring a neutral spine.
5.  **Abdominal Engagement:** Draw your lower abdomen gently inward to engage the core muscles.
6.  **Shoulder Position:** Roll your shoulders back and down, allowing your chest to open.
7.  **Arm Alignment:** Extend your arms by your sides, palms facing forward, fingers actively reaching down.
8.  **Neck and Head Position:** Lengthen your neck, aligning the head with the spine. Gaze straight ahead.
9.  **Breathing:** Breathe deeply and evenly, focusing on the expansion of the chest and ribcage.
10.  **Mindful Awareness:** Bring awareness to the present moment, maintaining a sense of stability and balance.
11.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold Tadasana for 30 seconds to a minute, gradually increasing the duration as you become more comfortable.
