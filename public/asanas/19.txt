Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose)
=========================

Bhujangasana, or Cobra Pose, is a backbend yoga posture that involves lying on the stomach and lifting the upper body using the strength of the back muscles. In this pose, the palms are placed beneath the shoulders, and the chest is lifted while keeping the lower body grounded. Cobra Pose promotes flexibility in the spine, strengthens the back muscles, and opens the chest, improving posture and respiratory function. The pose also stimulates abdominal organs, aiding digestion. Bhujangasana is often incorporated into yoga sequences for its energizing and revitalizing effects, fostering a sense of rejuvenation and enhancing the overall flexibility of the spine.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin by lying on your stomach with your legs extended, tops of the feet on the mat, and forehead resting on the floor.
2.  **Hand Placement:** Place your hands on the mat beside your shoulders, fingers pointing forward and palms pressing into the ground.
3.  **Elbow Alignment:** Ensure your elbows are tucked close to your body.
4.  **Legs and Pelvis:** Press the tops of your feet into the mat and engage your leg muscles. Draw your pubic bone toward the floor to stabilize the pelvis.
5.  **Inhale and Lift:** Inhale as you gently lift your head, chest, and upper abdomen off the mat. Keep your gaze forward, and avoid compressing the back of the neck.
6.  **Shoulder Blades Together:** Roll your shoulder blades back and together, broadening the chest. Keep your shoulders away from your ears.
7.  **Arm Strength:** Use the strength of your back muscles to lift, not your hands. Elbows should be slightly bent.
8.  **Breathing:** Breathe deeply and comfortably in the pose, maintaining a relaxed neck.
9.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold Bhujangasana for 15-30 seconds, gradually increasing the duration with practice.
10.  **Release:** Exhale as you gently lower your chest and head back to the mat.
11.  **Rest:** Rest in Child's Pose or on your stomach for a moment to release any tension.
12.  **Modifications:** If you're a beginner, start with a gentle lift and gradually progress to a higher lift. Keep the elbows slightly bent to avoid hyperextension.
