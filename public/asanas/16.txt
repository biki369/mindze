Garudasana (Eagle Pose)
=======================

Garudasana, or Eagle Pose, is a standing yoga posture that combines strength, balance, and flexibility. In this asana, one leg is wrapped around the other, while the arms are crossed at the elbows, intertwining like branches. The pose enhances concentration, balance, and focus, requiring a steady gaze and mindful breathing. Garudasana stretches the shoulders, upper back, and thighs, promoting joint mobility and flexibility. It stimulates the flow of energy throughout the body and can be beneficial for those with sciatica. However, individuals with knee or ankle issues should practice with caution, and modifications can be made to accommodate varying levels of flexibility.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin in a standing position, with your feet hip-width apart and arms by your sides.
2.  **Transfer Weight to One Leg:** Shift your weight onto your left foot and lift your right foot off the floor.
3.  **Leg Wrap:** Cross your right thigh over the left thigh, hooking the right foot around the left calf if possible. The thighs should be as close as comfortable.
4.  **Balance:** Find your balance on the left leg. Engage your core muscles to stabilize your torso.
5.  **Arm Cross:** Extend your arms forward at shoulder height. Cross the right arm over the left arm at the elbows. Bend your elbows, bringing your palms together. If this is challenging, you can also press the backs of your hands together.
6.  **Gaze and Breathing:** Fix your gaze on a point in front of you to help with balance. Maintain steady and deep breaths throughout the pose.
7.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold the position for 15-30 seconds or longer, depending on your comfort and practice level.
8.  **Release:** Unwind your arms and legs slowly. Return to the standing position with feet hip-width apart.
9.  **Switch Sides:** Repeat the same sequence on the other side, wrapping the left thigh over the right and crossing the left arm over the right.
