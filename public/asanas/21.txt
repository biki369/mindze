Sirsasana (Headstand)
=====================

Sirsasana, commonly known as the Headstand, is a revered yoga pose that involves balancing the body on the head and forearms, with the legs extended upward. This inversion is celebrated for its numerous physical and mental benefits. It enhances blood circulation to the brain, fostering mental clarity and concentration. Sirsasana strengthens the shoulders, arms, and core muscles while improving balance and posture. Practicing this pose also stimulates the lymphatic system, boosting immune function. However, it requires careful alignment, gradual progression, and supervision for beginners to avoid strain or injury. Regular practice of Sirsasana contributes to overall well-being, promoting both physical and mental equilibrium.

Steps
-----

1.  **Prepare Your Space:** Choose a clear, open area with a non-slip surface. Use a yoga mat to provide padding for your head and forearms.
2.  **Warm-up:** Engage in a thorough warm-up, focusing on your shoulders, core, and neck. Include poses like Downward-Facing Dog, Plank, and Dolphin Pose.
3.  **Interlace Your Fingers:** Kneel on the mat and interlace your fingers, placing them on the mat. Create a triangle with your hands, keeping the elbows shoulder-width apart.
4.  **Place Your Head on the Mat:** Set the crown of your head on the mat within the triangle formed by your hands. The back of your head should press gently against your clasped fingers.
5.  **Lift Your Hips:** Lift your hips toward the ceiling, straightening your legs. Walk your feet in as close as possible, maintaining a straight line from your head to your hips.
6.  **Lift One Leg:** Lift one leg toward the ceiling, keeping the other foot on the ground. This helps you gradually shift your weight and find balance.
7.  **Lift Both Legs:** Once comfortable with one leg lifted, gradually lift the other leg, extending both legs upward. Engage your core to maintain stability.
8.  **Find Balance:** Balance is crucial in Sirsasana. Keep your focus on a point between your hands and avoid any sudden movements.
9.  **Hold the Pose:** Hold the Headstand for a duration that is comfortable for you. Beginners may start with shorter holds and gradually increase over time.
10.  **Exit Safely:** To come down, lower one leg at a time with control. Rest in Child's Pose or another comfortable position to release any tension.
11.  **Practice Regularly:** Consistent practice helps improve strength and balance. Gradually increase the duration as your comfort and stability grow.
