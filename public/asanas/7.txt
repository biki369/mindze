Trikonasana (Triangle Pose)
===========================

**

Trikonasana, or Triangle Pose, is a foundational yoga posture that emphasizes stretching and lengthening. In this asana, practitioners stand with legs wide apart, extending one arm downward to touch the toes of the opposite foot while the other arm extends upward, creating a triangular shape. The feet are typically positioned at a 90-degree angle. Triangle Pose engages the core, stretches the spine, hips, and hamstrings, and opens the chest. It promotes balance, flexibility, and strengthens the legs. With its grounding and expansive qualities, Trikonasana is valued for its ability to improve posture, stimulate abdominal organs, and provide a sense of overall rejuvenation.
