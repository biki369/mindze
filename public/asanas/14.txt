Vrikshasana (Tree Pose)
=======================

Vrikshasana, or Tree Pose, is a grounding and balancing yoga pose that mimics the stability of a tree. Standing on one leg, the foot is placed on the inner thigh or calf, with arms raised overhead or in a prayer position at the heart center. This pose strengthens the legs, improves balance, and enhances concentration. Vrikshasana also promotes hip flexibility and opens the chest, fostering a sense of rootedness and poise. Embodying the grace and strength of a tree, this pose symbolizes balance, growth, and connection to the earth, making it a popular inclusion in yoga practices worldwide.

Steps
-----

1.  **Starting Position:** Begin in Tadasana (Mountain Pose), standing tall with your feet together and arms by your sides.
2.  **Shift Weight:** Shift your weight onto your right foot, grounding it firmly into the mat.
3.  **Lift the Left Foot:** Bend your left knee and bring the sole of your left foot to the inner right thigh. Place it above or below the knee, avoiding direct pressure on the knee joint.
4.  **Align Hips:** Ensure that your pelvis is squared and your hips are facing forward. Engage the muscles of the standing leg.
5.  **Hands in Prayer Position:** Bring your palms together in a prayer position in front of your chest (Anjali Mudra).
6.  **Extend Arms Overhead:** Inhale and slowly raise your arms overhead, keeping the palms pressed together. Your gaze can be fixed on a focal point for balance.
7.  **Find a Drishti (Gazing Point):** Choose a fixed point in front of you to maintain focus and balance. This is your drishti.
8.  **Hold the Pose:** Maintain the pose for 20-30 seconds or longer, focusing on your breath and staying steady.
9.  **Release Gracefully:** Exhale as you gently lower your arms and bring the left foot back to the mat.
10.  **Repeat on the Other Side:** Repeat the sequence, shifting your weight to the left foot and placing the right foot on the inner left thigh.

Tips
----

*   If placing the foot on the inner thigh is challenging, you can rest it on the inner calf or ankle while avoiding the knee joint.
*   Use a wall or a sturdy object for support if needed, especially if you're a beginner.
*   Keep the standing leg strong and active throughout the pose.
