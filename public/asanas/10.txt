Dhanurasana (Bow Pose)
======================

Dhanurasana, or Bow Pose, is an invigorating backbend in yoga. In this asana, practitioners lie on their stomachs, bending their knees and reaching back to hold their ankles. By lifting the chest and thighs off the ground, the body forms a bow-like shape. Dhanurasana strengthens the back muscles, opens the chest, and improves spinal flexibility. It stimulates the digestive organs, enhances lung capacity, and energizes the entire body. As a heart-opening pose, it is associated with increased vitality, emotional release, and a sense of empowerment, making it a dynamic and transformative addition to yoga practice.
