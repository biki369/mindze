Shalabhasana (Locust Pose)
==========================

Shalabhasana, or Locust Pose, is a yoga asana that targets the back, buttocks, and legs. In this prone position, practitioners lift the legs and upper body simultaneously, resembling a locust in flight. The pose strengthens the lower back, tones the muscles along the spine, and stimulates the abdominal organs. Shalabhasana enhances flexibility in the shoulders, chest, and thighs while improving posture. Additionally, it engages the buttocks and helps alleviate sciatic pain. Regular practice of Locust Pose not only builds physical strength but also promotes mental focus and resilience. It is advisable to approach this pose with proper alignment and gradually increase intensity.
